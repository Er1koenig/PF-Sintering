A simulation model based Wang's work (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2005.10.032) is built to evaluate the solid-state sintering behavior. Cahn-Hillard equation is used for density evolution, Allen-Cahn equation for grain orientation evolution. Rigid body motion is considered by introducing the force and torque.
